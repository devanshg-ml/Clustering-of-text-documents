Dataset: smaller dataset cnnhealth.txt.zip  download The format of this file is different from the original one. It has 3 columns, separated by "|". You only need to use the last column.

The original one:

Dataset: tweets from health news accounts: HealthNewsTweets.zip  download 

Each line is a tweet. In total there are should be around 58K tweets. 

A paper has used this dataset: 1705.00995.pdf (T-dataset in the paper)

Goals: 
1. use Bag-Of-Words approach to convert the raw data into a matrix. Each row is a tweet, represented by a vector of word frequency. Please see a simple introduction here (Links to an external site.). You may also use scikit-learn to construct the feature vectors. Please see an introduction here (Links to an external site.). Please output the matrix into a txt file.

2. Define at least two distance measures and output them into two files. In your report, explain why you select these two measures.
